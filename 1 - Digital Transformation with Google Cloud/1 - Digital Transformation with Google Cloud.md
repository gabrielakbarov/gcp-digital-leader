## 1.3 Cloud Computing Models and Shared Responsibility

<ul>

  <li><strong>Types of cloud services:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Iaas</strong> delivers on-demand infrastructure resources, like compute, storage or networking. The service provider owns and operates the infrastructure, while customers need to purchase and manage software, such as operating systems, middleware, data and applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Paas</strong> delivers and manages hardware and software resources for developing, testing, delivering and managing cloud applications. Providers typically offer middleware, development tools and cloud databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Saas</strong> provides a full application stack as a service that customers can access and use. SaaS solutions often come as ready-to-use applications, which are managed and maintained by the cloud service provider.</li>
    </ul>

  <li><strong>Comparing cloud services:</strong></li>
